JunkwareRemoval is a small batch script designed to remove a lot of the Microsoft bloat from new systems running Windows 10 and 11 in a quick fashion. Due to the nature of Microsoft edge not even providing an uninstall button, some features will be forcily removed.


The items that will be forcibly removed are:

-  Microsoft Edge
-  Microsoft OneDrive
-  Microsoft XBoxLive

Please note, you may need to re-run this script (or manually remove the items again) if you happen to notice Microsoft updates were installed overnight without your consent. Chances are, Microsoft readded some if not all of these items back to your system.
Feedback welcomed. Inspired by clients that want these items off their systems as there are way better non-intrusive alternatives. 

This script is obviously free to use but if you wanted to donate something, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/C2QC509ZM1BG?ref_=wl_share">this Amazon Wishlist link</a>. Thank you!
